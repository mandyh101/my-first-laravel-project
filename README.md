# My first laravel project

I started this project to learn how to build a web application with the laravel framework. I have been completting work and features following the guidance of a Laracast series called 'Laravel from scratch'.

Key elements I have learned throough this project include:
- working with .blade files
- building routes and controller actions
- setting up Model files, and working with database factories and seeders.

# Get started
- `composer install`
- front end dependencies `npm install`
- spin up server `php artisan serve`


# Debugging
- install clockwork : `composer require itsgoingd/clockwork` . Find docs: https://github.com/itsgoingd/clockwork
